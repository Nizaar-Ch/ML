Machine learning project (AI Bsc year 2)
Excercise 1:
1. Exact command line is ''ssh scur2259@snellius.surf.nl''
2. I had a password authentication problem, i accidentally typed in the wrong password in the terminal. But this gave no error message. Solution: typing the right password.
3. I used ssh before for the WebTech project last year. The keys are installed as id_ed25519
